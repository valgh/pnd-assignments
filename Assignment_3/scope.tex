\section{Scope and Initial Considerations}
The scope of this assignment is to setup a \textbf{Virtual Private Network} through \textbf{OpenVPN} in \textbf{OPNSense} to allow three authenticated \textit{Road Warriors} to access the internal subnetworks of \textbf{ACME Co.}, and to grant the usage of a \textbf{proxy server} on machine located at \textbf{100.100.6.3} -  which corresponds to domain \textbf{proxy.acme.group27} to the very same authenticated internal clients of the network to reach the \textbf{WAN} outside the \textbf{Main Firewall}.\\
Since these tasks are going to allow connections from the outside - even if authenticated and thus probably secured - it is a good idea to make sure, as a first step, that every user on each of the internal machines is protected by a strong password, and we will probably also have to confirm that the SSH protocol on each machine behaves as we expect it to behave and described in the previous assignments.\\
The next paragraphs will only deal with the two services we want to setup in the target network - \textbf{VPN} and \textbf{proxy server}.
