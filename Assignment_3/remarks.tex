\section{Final remarks}
\textbf{OpenVPN} and \textbf{Squid Proxy} services were both configured and tested successfully during this assignment, and we believe their deployment comply with the policies and requirements provided by the assignment itself.\\
One point that we want to stress again though, is the fact that both services rely on \textbf{basic authentication}, which is commonly known to be the weakest form of authentication. That's why these two services should be supported by other protection layers, such as proper \textbf{firewall rules} for both \textbf{WAN interface} and \textbf{Proxy machine}, and \textbf{Public Key based Authentication} at least for every \textbf{SSH service} in the internal subnetworks of our target network. A good general idea should be to make it possible for the users to login on these machines via \textbf{SSH} only through public keys, and not through basic authentication.\\
While we believe the \textbf{firewall rules} defined in the previous assignment to be sufficient, we should continuously monitor the login's behavior on the internal machines via \textbf{SSH} service.
