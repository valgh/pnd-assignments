\section{Final remarks and possible improvements}
Some improvements are still possible to this setup: one issue that we may not be able to actually address is the possible physical shut down of the \textbf{arpwatch-clients} machine, which may lead to the monitoring task not being carried out.\\
Some extra-measures could be taken to disable SSH on the arpwatch machine or, at least, to enable it only via \textit{public key} authentication and disabling the \textit{basic authentication} via password, even if these were changed from their default ones. To keep using \textit{basic authentication} on SSH, a feasible solution would be to implement a password policy that forces users on the \textbf{arpwatch-clients} machine to change their password frequently - say, at least every week.\\
Another improvement that should be performed, is that of disabling the \textbf{root} account on every machine in the subnetwork - \textbf{root} is a well-known, default super user that almost every Unix machine has, so it's a well-known target for attackers.\\
Nonetheless, some of the basic security measures were implemented to enforce security on the subnetwork's machines, and our main goal - to monitor the target LAN through \textbf{arpwatch} - has been carried out successfully.
