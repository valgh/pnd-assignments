\section{Tests}
We performed some basic tests for the DNS service and the new policy that were enabled and implemented in this assignment.\\
To perform thorough tests on the firewall rules we implemented, the WAN interface on the \textbf{Main router} was enabled, through the option provided in OPNSense, to accept private connections, so that it could be reached from external hosts (Internet, or our local machines).\\
