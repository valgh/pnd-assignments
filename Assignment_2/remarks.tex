\section{Final remarks}
The testing phase showed us that the policy, if correctly interpreted, was implemented as specified by the assignment.\\
Some extra measures could have been taken, and they are very similar to the ones we have seen in the first assignment: we need to perform Linux hardening via sudo and hardening of the SSH protocol for all the machines in the DMZ and Internal Service subnetworks, and we need to change the default passwords for services such as \textbf{Zentyal} too and for users on the machines as well.\\
Also, as a last step, when the whole configuration going on in these assignments is over, we should at least enable only one machine in the \textbf{Clients} subnetwork - the \textbf{Kali} machine, probably - to connect via HTTP service to the two routers, for administration and practical reasons, so as we mentioned in the previous paragraphs, the rule enabling these connections should be actually disabled as a last step.
