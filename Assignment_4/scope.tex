\section{Initial comments and scope}
This last assignment is meant to provide an additional level of defense to the \textbf{ACME CO. network} by setting up \textbf{Intrusion Prevention Systems}, both hosts-based and network-based, in the two firewalls of the network and in the hosts of the \textbf{DMZ} subnetwork.\\
Once these systems are fully operational, a \textbf{vulnerability assessment} is then carried out to find, examine and pinpoint the vulnerabilities that are still affecting the services that the ntetwork provides.\\
Given the goal of the \textbf{NIPS} that we are going to setup in the two firewalls - that is, to detect and prevent intrusions in the whole network, especially the one set up at the \textbf{Main firewall} - and given the fact that we have to consider all the services that the target network provides, the scope of the assignment is the entire network.\\
Please keep also in mind that the vulnerability assessment has actually its own scope and scenario, which is described in the fourth chapter.\\
